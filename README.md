First App Built (CRUD)
This is the first website I have developed so far, its Primary goal is to demonstrate my understanding of CRUD (Create Read Update Delete). 

Goals

Primary - CRUD web application 

Secondary - Some responsiveness, Useable, Easy to understand

Code

I have built experience by using Mongo DB, Express js, React js and Node js. This enabled me to see the relationship between these platforms and frameworks, whilst encountering problems which took thought and research to overcome.

Website Achievements

I am happy with the function of the website, this is a list of what I learnt;

Somewhat responsive layout, all images and cards do adjust to lower pixel screens
Content is sitting in a good place for the look of the site
Scaling and ratios are somewhat consistent
Manage page updates content on Rooms page
Manage page has some fail safes to stop server crashing (disabled buttons until content has been input)
State hooks are used to allow updating of rooms whilst using map function to create cards
Use of checkbox to change room availability

Website needed improvements

There are a lot of improvements needed and further learning;

Responsiveness does not scale correctly, cards end up different sizes 
Navbar doesn’t have enough content to showcase responsiveness
Design can be greatly improved with some focus
Manage page needs an autofill or change to code, so that users don’t have to enter all details to update rooms
Checkbox seems to be working in reverse which I have countered by explaining what ticking box does to availability once updated
Room image is currently a stored URL in Mongo DB, I would like the images to be uploaded to Mongo DB by user
